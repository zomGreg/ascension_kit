Ascension Kit
=============

Hello and welcome to ascension kit!

What is this?
-------------

Ascension Kit is a project I hacked together to show ascension details from the NAO player files.

What does it do?
----------------

I'm glad you asked. It displays information about player ascensions, and will return a table of user data if multiple user names are passed.

Multiple Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The format for a multiple user call is a table.

The player table is sorted by average turns, in ascending (heh, get it?) order.
Some of the data in the xlog files is incomplete, that's why anselmus seems to
have had a game with a 0-turn ascension. I'm not entirely sure what is the
cause of this anomaly, but I think it's to do with earlier game versions.

How does this work?
-------------------

Each player on NAO (http://alt.org/nethack/) has a player xlog file kept for
the games they've played. This utility fetches that file, and parses it to
present the data shown.

`Here is my xlog file <http://alt.org/nethack/player-all-xlog.php?player=zomGreg>`_

Files are fetched and saved to the `/tmp` directory and the cache timeout
period is 24 hours, which means the utility will not attempt to download an
xlog file if it was downloaded less than 24 hours ago. This is an effort to be
nice to the NAO server.
